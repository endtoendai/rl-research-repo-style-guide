## Introduction Documentation `README.md`

The `README.md` document is the first document that people will see when they visit your repository. Thus, it must be up-to-date and contain all useful information.

If you are not familiar with Markdown format `*.md`, check out [this cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet).



## Auxiliary Documents `docs/`

As your projects get large, your `README.md` will naturally get bigger. If will eventually become too big to be contained in a single file. Thus, you should separate the documents into relevant chunks. Keeping them in root directory would overpopulate the directory, so instead you should keep them in the `docs/` folder.

You can link the users from `README.md` to Markdown files in `docs/` with the following syntax:

```
[Link to docs/DOCS.md](docs/DOCS.md)
```
